Student marks prediction is a popular data science case study based on the problem of regression.
Student Marks Prediction -
You are given some information about students like:

1. The number of courses they have opted for
2. The average time studied per day by students
3. Marks obtained by students

The dataset used for the student marks prediction task is downloaded from Kaggle.
So there are only three columns in the dataset. The marks column is the target column as we have to predict the marks of a student.
